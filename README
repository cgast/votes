Mini voting tool for workshops where ideas have to be ranked anonymously by a group.

Every member of the group gets an url to invest a million into a mix of the ideas.

Plain PHP. No database needed: Investments / Votes are stored in a json file. The PHP files must be able to write in the votings directory.

To create a new voting call config.php.

Watch a demo here: http://votes.cgast.de

Cheers!
