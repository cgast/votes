Mini PHP web-voting tool for workshops where ideas have to be ranked anonymously by a group.

- Vote: Every member of the group gets an url to invest a million into a mix of the ideas.
- Display: Show the investments and the development on a big screen with the display page.
- Config: To create, freeze, reset a voting use config.php.

Plain PHP. No database needed: Investments / Votes are stored in a json file. The PHP files must be able to write in the votings directory.
